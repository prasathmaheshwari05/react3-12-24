*react is componenet basis technologu
-componenet:it is partial part of react project
            -which we can reuse through out react project
            -it can be any part of react project

-in react js- is a root componenet(main componenet)


-in react we have two type of componenet

1.function component: when your main focus is on UI design
2.class componenet: when your have to implement complex logic in tat case we use


*how to display componenet output
*JSX(javascript+XML):
-it allow us to write html code in react

*conditional Rendering
-display component on the basic conditional
1.use of if else: id condition is true then if block will execute otherwisse else block
2.element as variable:in variable we store data and display inside tag and return it
3.use of ternary operator: short hand syntax for if else
                            (condition)? truepart: falsepart;
